h1. Screen Manager Starter Kit

h2. Overview

This is a collection of configuration files to help you use screen to manage your project environments.

A few things that you can do with it:

* set environment variables (useful if you want to specify a version of Ruby to use for a project)
* automatically fire up a database server or something

See the source for examples

h2. Setup

<pre>
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/timcharper/screenmanager.git .screen
ln -s ~/.screen/screenrc .screen
echo ". ~/.screen/ss.bash" >> ~/.bash_profile
</pre>

Then, this being a starter kit, you'll need to modify the files to suit your needs.  See "sample" for an example of what's possible.

h2. Invoking

Depending on your setup, you commands will vary.  Once installed, type ss <env> to fire up or resume a screen session named one of ~/.screen/*.

h2. Conclusion

Have fun!
